Topic: algorithmic sentencing

argument for: humans r also unjust and AI would be less impacted by circumstances than ppl

automated decision-making (ADM)

humans still have to decide what the offense is
input would depend on judicial discretion
sentencing requires careful weighing of a range of factors

objections:
   - inherent superiority of human sentencing
       ADM can't take all the unique features in and weigh them
       too complex for an algorithm, 
       --> first part: too many factors that an algorithm cannot take into account
              -true but only a small amount of factors are relevant to sentencing
                 --> what factors are considered? depends on the theory you are using
                        - retributivist (compensation based)
                        - restorative (utilitarian - maximize happiness)
                        --> regardless of whetehr carried out by human judge or ADM
       --> second part: human judgement >
              - false: human judgement is unsuited to weighing multiple factors
