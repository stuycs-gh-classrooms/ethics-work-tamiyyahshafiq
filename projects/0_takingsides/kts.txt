Topic: algorithmic sentencing

argument for: humans r also unjust and AI would be less impacted by circumstances than ppl
- efficient: standardize, reducing human bias, can process quickly so faster, gets rid of individual biases or human emotions
- data-driven decisions can lead to more informed decisions
- can be transparent if public access

argument against:
- lack of transparency
- bias from historical data

automated decision-making (ADM)

humans still have to decide what the offense is
input would depend on judicial discretion
sentencing requires careful weighing of a range of factors

objections:
   - inherent superiority of human sentencing
       ADM can't take all the unique features in and weigh them
       too complex for an algorithm, 
       --> first part: too many factors that an algorithm cannot take into account
              -true but only a small amount of factors are relevant to sentencing
                 --> what factors are considered? depends on the theory you are using
                        - retributivist (compensation based)
                        - restorative (utilitarian - maximize happiness)
                        --> regardless of whetehr carried out by human judge or ADM
       --> second part: human judgement >
              - false: human judgement is unsuited to weighing multiple factors 
                  --> intuitive judgement "system 1 thinking" by cognitive sci is unsuited to the complex task of weighing multiple elements
                       THIS IS WHY ppl say lack of transparency, ADM can calculae mutliple including nonlinear and interacting features and weighed factors
                        as complexity goes up, exceeds human ability
   - if trained on historic data, bias
       --> only if we use machine learning models (know target, examples, history,  and can predict by looking at correlations)
       --> well-established set of theories of sentencing, teach the model this

CONDITIONAL:
1) properly designed ADM will better approximate sentencee
2) we have moral reason to employ sentencing method that best approximates the just senteence
    - if u think there is just sentencing, u accept
3) therefore, moral reason to apply ADM

for all counterclaims, either 1) deny ADM has undesirable property or 2) say that humans do too

objection 2: Privacy
  - access to large amount of data in development and use phasees, and this decreasees privacy of those data is abt
  - doeesn't need more/diff data than a human judge  bc no  machine learning, do not need data just ethics or data already in criminological literature (development phase)
  - use: doesn't need more than a human

object 3: transparency
  - opaque so can't challenge or review decision - those subject to it shld be able to understand basis
  - transparent if relevant person can understand how it works (peerson can predict output for input)
  - only be if priv companies who want  code  private, but you could  have it fully vailable to public
  - complexity from factors also  to human
  - human-deecision making is not transparent, even ur ownd ecisions, thats why often put inaccurate reasons to a claim

object 4: bias
  - bias usually bc of existing inequalities 
  - 2 ways becomes biased: reproduce bias in training data, or employ features whose values vary a cross relevant populations (like highr risk for communs w higher pov rate)
  - no training data bc no machine learnning, but can to second type
	- solution: direct discrimination in  favor of a minority making more lenientt "affirmative action"
  - also humans

premise: just sentencing existts

tradittional v human: jury verdict, judge sentence, parole board rejoin societety --> can  reduce bias by using AI

COMPAS risk a ssessment took over doctor/psychologistt

if same senteneces then replace?
