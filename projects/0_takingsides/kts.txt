Topic: algorithmic sentencing

argument for: humans r also unjust and AI would be less impacted by circumstances than ppl

automated decision-making (ADM)

humans still have to decide what the offense is
input would depend on judicial discretion
sentencing requires careful weighing of a range of factors

objections:
   - inherent superiority of human sentencing
       ADM can't take all the unique features in and weigh them
       too complex for an algorithm,
